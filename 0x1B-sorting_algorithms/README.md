## Background Context
> This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

## Learning Objectives
> At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
 - At least four different sorting algorithms
 - What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
 - How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
 - What is a stable sorting algorithm
