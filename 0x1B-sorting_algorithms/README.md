#0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

##Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

##General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
